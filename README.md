# StockPredictor
Java Stock Predictor based on historical stock prices of each stock symbol. 
This Stock Predictor uses a Neural Network imported from "deeplearning4j" to predict the stock prices of a given symbol for the next 20 days from execution.
To use it, download the code, open it in your IDE, and run the 'Main.java' file; finally input the stock symbol whose prices you want to predict. Done!
